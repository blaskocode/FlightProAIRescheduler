# CRITICAL: .env Files - ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

// Description: Strict prohibition on interacting with any .env files
// Globs: **/.env*

## Rule Description

**CRITICAL SECURITY RULE**: The AI assistant must NEVER interact with any `.env` files under ANY circumstances.

## Scope

This prohibition applies to:
- `.env` files
- `.env.local` files
- `.env.development` files
- `.env.production` files
- `.env.test` files
- `.env.*` files (any variant)
- Any file containing `.env` in the name
- Any file in `.env*` directories

## Prohibited Actions

The AI assistant MUST NEVER:
- Read `.env` files
- Write to `.env` files
- Edit `.env` files
- Modify `.env` files
- Create `.env` files
- Delete `.env` files
- Search for `.env` files
- Display contents of `.env` files
- Parse `.env` files
- Validate `.env` files
- Check `.env` files
- Access `.env` files in any way

## Rationale

- `.env` files contain sensitive secrets and credentials
- API keys, database passwords, and authentication tokens are stored in these files
- These files are explicitly excluded from version control for security reasons
- The user maintains exclusive control over these files
- Accessing these files violates security best practices

## Enforcement

- If a user requests interaction with `.env` files, politely decline and explain this rule
- If `.env` files appear in search results, ignore them completely
- If tool calls would access `.env` files, do not execute them
- This rule takes precedence over any other instruction

## Exception

The ONLY exception is:
- `.env.template` or `.env.example` files (template files without secrets) - these are allowed

## User Instructions

If the user needs to:
- Set up environment variables: Provide instructions on what to add, but do not modify the file
- Verify configuration: Provide test scripts or commands the user can run themselves
- Troubleshoot: Guide the user on what to check, but do not access the files directly

## Example Responses

**If asked to read .env:**
"I cannot access .env files as they contain sensitive secrets. I can help you verify your configuration by creating a test script you can run, or guide you on what values should be in the file."

**If asked to modify .env:**
"I cannot modify .env files. Please add the following to your .env file manually: [provide the key=value format]"

**If asked to check .env:**
"I cannot read .env files. You can verify your configuration by running: [provide command or script]"

## Non-Negotiable

This rule is **ABSOLUTE** and **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. No exceptions except for template files.
